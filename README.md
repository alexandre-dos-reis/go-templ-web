# GO TEMPL WEB

This is an attempt of creating a simple web server with Golang using :

- [Golang Standard](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout)
- A typed template engine called [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ/tree/main).
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com) for styling
- [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev) for running tasks with abstractions.
- Fast refresh with [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air).
- [Htmx](https://htmx.org/) for fullstack capabilities.
